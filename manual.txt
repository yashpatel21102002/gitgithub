1. git init

3. git commit -m "messaage"
4. git push > into github
5. git log

10. git remote add origin url.git {
	to add url to the working project
}
11. git remote -v {
	shows url that are connected to our project
}

12. git push origin master


note => we should not commit on the main or the master branch

Not finalized code should go to another branch  so that users that are currently using main branch code doesn't affect.

if branch contains head means that it is the current working directory 

now make branching to use this effectively

13. git branch <branch_name>

to allocate the head to that new branch run below command 

14. git checkout <branch_name>

now all new commits and adding will happen to this branch and main or master branch will be unaffected
